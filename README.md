HydraBus Schematic and Board
========

The HydraBus is an open source multi-tool hardware for anyone interested in Learning/Developping/Debugging/Hacking/Penetration Testing for basic or advanced embedded hardware.

The MCU is one of the fastest Cortex M4F on the market and is more than 40X faster than an Arduino (STM32F415, 32bits@168MHz=210DMIPS vs Arduino Uno, 8bits@16MHz=5.2DMIPS).

HydraBus can be also used as Test Bench for hardware validation/test with help of embedded python script or native C/C++ firmware and it is a perfect tool for hardware pentesting.

HydraBus is evolutive with the help of “Shield” hardware extensions (first Shield is HydraNFC).
